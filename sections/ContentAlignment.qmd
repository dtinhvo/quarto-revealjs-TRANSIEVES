# Content alignment

To manual line break, `\n` will not work -> use `<br>`

## Columns 

- To use with `.columns`, care is needed: 
    - force full width for columns `style="width: 100%;"`
    - properly .block other contents `::: {.block}`
    - only split col inside `::: {.column}   :::` 
    - Collumn size with `width=` 
      - WARNING! `style="width: 40%"` is NOT correct!
